# General patterns for C compilation artifacts
# Ignore all files without extensions in subdirectories (likely executables)
**/[!.]*/[!.]*
!**/*.c
!**/*.h
!**/*.md
!**/*.txt
!**/README*
!**/Makefile*

# Alternative approach: ignore common executable patterns
# Uncomment these lines if the above doesn't work as expected:
# *.exe
# *.out
# a.out

# macOS specific
.DS_Store

# Common C compilation artifacts
*.o
*.obj
*.so
*.dylib
*.a
*.lib

# IDE and editor files
.vscode/
.idea/
*.swp
*.swo
*~

# Backup files
*.bak
*.backup
