# C Programming Exercises

A curated collection of effective C programming exercises for software developers at various skill levels.

## Overview

This repository contains carefully selected programming exercises in C that I've found particularly effective in building programming skills. The exercises are sourced from various online resources and programming textbooks, filtered to focus on the most impactful problems for learning.

## Purpose

These exercises are designed to:

- Strengthen core programming concepts
- Develop problem-solving skills
- Improve understanding of C language specifics
- Build a solid foundation for software development

## Repository Structure

Each exercise is contained in its own directory with:

- A detailed README.md explaining the problem, algorithm, and implementation details
- Source code file(s) with the solution
- Any additional resources needed for the exercise

Current exercises:
- [`isPrime`](./isPrime) - Determines whether a given number is prime
- [`hallowSquare`](./hallowSquare) - Creates a hollow square pattern

## Prerequisites
